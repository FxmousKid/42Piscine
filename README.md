## Piscine Description
The piscine of School42 is a incredible experience, it's basically a hardcore extra-social coding from scratch bootcamp where you spend 25 days from sunrise to sunset coding, learning new things, talking to people, tinkering with your login session, petting the cat, and most importantly get to meet what i consider people i'll never forget.
